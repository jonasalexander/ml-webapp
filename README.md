## Development

First, start the front-end webserver by navigating to `frontend/` and running `npm start`. If you go to `http://localhost:3000`, you'll be able to see the start page titled "Create a Prediction API from a CSV File".

Then, start the back-end by navigating to `backend/` and running `python server.py`. Now, if you fill out the first page of inputs in the front-end, your data will be sent to the backend and you should be able to see a Validation page after submitting the first page.
